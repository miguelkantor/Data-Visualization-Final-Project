# Data-Visualization-Final-Project

## What is your topic?  

Our topic is NYC Parking Tickets. Our dataset contains 2.7 million NYC parking violations from 2013 to 2024.  

## What issues or questions are you addressing?  

We want to understand the dynamics of parking ticket issuance in NYC. We want to know at what times and on which days certain types of violations happen. We want to explore which precincts have a higher incidence of which violations. It will also be interesting to investigate what vehicle types (buses, trucks) are more prone to which types of violations. We will also try to find seasonal trends  in different types of violations.  

## What is the source of the data you will be using?  

The city of New York publishes this data. We found it on Kaggle, where it was posted anonymously. Here is a link to the Kaggle page for this dataset. 

## What statistical techniques do you think you may be using?  

We will be grouping the data by varying dimensions: day-of-the-week, hour, precincts, and so on. This will allow us to compare violation volumes at different levels of granularity and make appropriate comparisons. We will use scatterplots to visualize certain correlations, where they may be present. We will use bar charts to see which precincts have the highest violations on which days, which might be useful information for the NYPD.
